Real-world dataset cleaning and exploratory data analysis using Python and Pandas.


# Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains my work on cleaning, preprocessing, and exploring a real-world dataset using Python in Google Colab.  
The objective of this project was to convert raw data into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format while ensuring data reliability and consistency.

## Dataset Introduction
Dataset used: Airbnb Open Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata)

The dataset used in this project consists of structured tabular data with a combination of numerical and categorical features.  
Like most real-world datasets, it contained missing values, inconsistent formatting, incorrect data types, and noisy entries that required systematic cleaning before meaningful analysis could be performed.

## What I Did in the Colab Notebook
In the Google Colab notebook, I carried out the following steps:

- Explored the dataset to understand its structure, features, and summary statistics  
- Identified missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues  
- Standardized column names for readability and consistency  
- Converted columns to appropriate data types  
- Handled missing values using suitable techniques based on the data context  
- Cleaned and corrected invalid or noisy records  
- Verified the dataset after cleaning to ensure data integrity
